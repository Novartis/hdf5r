# Note

**Please note that the newest version of hdf5 1.12.0 is currently not supported. Use version 1.10.x until a fix is released**

**hdf5r** is an R interface to the [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) library. It is implemented using [R6](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6) classes based on the [HDF5-C-API](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5Front.html). The package supports all data-types as specified by HDF5 (including references) and provides many convenience functions yet also an extensive selection of the native HDF5-C-API functions. **hdf5r** is available on [Github](https://github.com/hhoeflin/hdf5r) and has already been released on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hdf5r) for all major platforms (Windows, OS X, Linux). It is also 
tested using several hundred assertions.

[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) is an excellent library and data model to 
store huge amounts of data in a binary file format. Supporting most major 
platforms and programming languages it can be used to exchange data files in a 
language independent format. Compared to R's integrated *save()* and *load()* 
functions it also supports access to only parts of the binary data files and can
therefore be used to process data not fitting into memory.

# Install

**hdf5r** is available for all major platforms, namely Linux, OS X and Windows. 
The package is compatible with HDF5 version 1.8.13 or higher (also Version 1.10.0). 

## Requirements

For OS X and Linux the HDF5 library needs to be installed via one of the (shell) commands specified below:

| System                                    | Command
|:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
|**OS X (using Homebrew)**                  | `brew install hdf5`
|**Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu)**| `sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev` 
|**Systems supporting yum and RPMs**        | `sudo yum install hdf5-devel`

HDF5 1.8.14 has been pre-compiled for Windows and is available at https://github.com/mannau/h5-libwin - thus no manual installation is required.

## Basic Install

The latest release version of **hdf5r** can be installed from any CRAN [Mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) using the R command
```r
install.packages("hdf5r")
```
For the latest development version from Github you can use
```r
devtools::install_github("hhoeflin/hdf5r")
```

# Getting Started

## How to Get Help

The package provides most of the regular HDF5-API in addition to a number of convenience functions. As such, the number of available methods is 
quite large. As the package uses R6 classes, all applicable methods for a class are contained in that class. The easiest way to get an 
overview of the available methods is to call the *methods* method. 

```r
native_int_type <- h5types$H5T_NATIVE_INT
native_int_type$methods()
```

Of course, there is also the regular R help that you can call for each class. These help pages tend to be long, as they also document all
methods of that class.

```r
help("H5T-class")
```

Last, I very much recomment reading the included vignette. You can view all vignettes included in the pacakge with

```r
vignette(package="hdf5r")
```

and call up the introduction vignette with

```r
vignette("hdf5r", package="hdf5r")
```


## Simple Code Example

If you don't have time to read the vignette, which contains more code example, here is a very brief code example to 
create a file, write some data and read it back again.

```r
test_file <- tempfile(fileext=".h5")
file.h5 <- H5File$new(test_file, mode="w")

data(cars)
file.h5$create_group("test")
file.h5[["test/cars"]] <- cars
cars_ds <- file.h5[["test/cars"]]
h5attr(cars_ds, "rownames") <- rownames(cars)

## Close the file at the end
## the 'close' method closes only the file-id, but leaves object inside the file open
## This may prevent re-opening of the file. 'close_all' closes the file and all objects in it
file.h5$close_all()
```


```r
## now re-open it 
file.h5 <- H5File$new(test_file, mode="r+")

## lets look at the content
file.h5$ls(recursive=TRUE)

cars_ds <- file.h5[["test/cars"]]
## note that for now tables in HDF5 are 1-dimensional, not 2-dimensional
mycars <- cars_ds[]
h5attr_names(cars_ds)
h5attr(cars_ds, "rownames")

file.h5$close_all()
```

# 64-bit Integers

Please note that for 64-bit signed integers, the bit64 package is used. For technical reasons, it is possible for a function that is not bit64-aware to misrepresent 64bit values from the bit64 package as 'doubles' of a completely different value. Therefore, please be advised to ensure that the functions you are using are bit64-aware or cast the values to regular numeric values (but be aware - this may result in a loss of precision). For illustration of this issue see the difference between `print(as.integer64(1))` and `cat(as.integer64(1), "\n")`. Another possible source of issues can be `matrix(as.integer64(1))` or `min(as.integer64(1), as.integer64(2))`, among possibly others. By default, hdf5r tries to return regular R objects (integer or double) wherever this is possible without loss of precision. If you need 64bit integers, proceed with care keeping these issues in mind.
