Description: 'HDF5' is a data model, library and file format for storing 
    and managing large amounts of data. This package provides a nearly
    feature complete, object oriented  wrapper for the 'HDF5' 'API'
    <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5Front.html> using R6 classes. 
    Additionally, functionality is added so that 'HDF5' objects behave very 
    similar to their corresponding R counterparts.
