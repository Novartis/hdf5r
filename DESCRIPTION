Description: This package provides an interface to the HDF5 API. HDF5 is a
    data model, library and file format for storing and managing data. The HDF5
    API is written in C. This package provides functions in R that allow access to
    the underlying C functions. Additionally, functionality is added so that HDF5-
    datasets behave very similar to native R datatypes.
