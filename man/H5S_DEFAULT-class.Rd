\value{
Object of class \code{\link[=H5S_DEFAULT-class]{H5S_DEFAULT}}.
}
\description{
It inherits all functions of the \code{\link{H5S-class}}. As this is implemented, this is likely not the best choice as almost
all functions that work for H5S-class objects will fail. It is likely better to implement this as a separate default class,
avoid the id-tracking associated with it (which doesn't make sense anyway). Should find a better way to handle this.
