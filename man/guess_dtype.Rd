\title{Guess the HDF5 datatype of an R object}
\usage{
guess_nelem(x, dtype)

guess_dim(x)

guess_dtype(x, ds_dim = NULL, scalar = FALSE,
  string_len = getOption("hdf5r.default_string_len"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object for which to guess the HDF5 datatype or the dimension or the number of elements}

\item{dtype}{datatype; used in guessing the number of dataset elements of an r object}

\item{ds_dim}{Can explicitly set the dimension of the dataset object. For \code{scalar}, this is one. Otherwise, this can be
used so that a multi-dimensional object can be represented so that some of its dimension are in the dataset, and some are inside an
\code{\link{H5T_ARRAY-class}}}

\item{scalar}{Should the datatype be created so that \code{x} can be represented as a scalar with that datatype? This is intended
to know if a vector/array should be represented as an \code{\link{H5T_ARRAY-class}} or not.}

\item{string_len}{If a string is in the R object, the length to which the corresponding HDF5 type should be set. If it is a
positive integer, the string is of that length. If it is \code{Inf}, it is variable length. If it is set to \code{estimate},
it is set to the length of the longest string in the \code{x}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{H5T-class}} that represents the HDF5-type of the Robj that was passed in
}
\description{
Guess the HDF5 datatype of an R object
}
\details{
Given an object, it creates a datatype in HDF5 that would match this object. For simple datasets like arrays, this
function is not so useful, but is very good for creating dataframes or hierarchical objects (like lists of dataframes) etc.
